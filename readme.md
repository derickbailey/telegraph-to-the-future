# A Telegraph To The Future Of Web Apps

A Presentation by Derick Bailey, for Nodevember 2015.

## Abstract Things

In the real world, messages are everywhere. They coordinate activities. They make things happen. They send back results. We are surrounded by messages, day in and day out, as we interact with other people - and as we build applications for the web!

From HTTP and AJAX with JSON documents, to Web Workers and iFrames, to scaling the back-end of Node.js, the web is steeped in messaging patterns. Use them. Take advantage of them. Improve your app design, simplify your code and reduce response time!

In this session, you'll learn what messaging is and how messaging patterns are part of your work, already. You'll see the benefit of making these implicit patterns explicit in your code. And, you'll learn how messaging can take your architecture from a flock of seagull's screaching "MINE! MINE! MINE!", to a highly trained and coordinated team.
